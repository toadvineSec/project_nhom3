      <div>
        Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and
        populated by you, the Reddit users. Through these communities, you can
        post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect with
        people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find—or even
        create—your home on Reddit. While not every community may be for you
        (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community
        should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of
        belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others.
        Likewise, everyone on Reddit should have an expectation of privacy and
        safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others. Every
        community on Reddit is defined by its users. Some of these users help
        manage the community as moderators. The culture of each community is
        shaped explicitly, by the community rules enforced by moderators, and
        implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its community
        members. Please abide by the rules of communities in which you
        participate and do not interfere with those in which you are not a
        member. Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide
        rules that apply to everyone on Reddit. These rules are enforced by us,
        the admins. Reddit and its communities are only what we make of them
        together, and can only exist if we operate by a shared set of rules. We
        ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit
        as well.
      </div>
      <h1>Rules</h1>
      <h2>Rule 1</h2>
      <div>
        Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and
        belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of
        people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying,
        and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or
        that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
      </div>
      <h2>Rule 2</h2>
      <div>
        Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into communities where
        you have a personal interest, and do not cheat or engage in content
        manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or
        subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt Reddit
        communities.
      </div>
      <h2>Rule 3</h2>
      <div>
        Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by
        revealing someone’s personal or confidential information, is not
        allowed. Never post or threaten to post intimate or sexually-explicit
        media of someone without their consent.
      </div>
      <h2>Rule 4</h2>
      <div>
        Do not share or encourage the sharing of sexual, abusive, or suggestive
        content involving minors. Any predatory or inappropriate behavior
        involving a minor is also strictly prohibited.
      </div>
      <h2>Rule 5</h2>
      <div>
        You don’t have to use your real name to use Reddit, but don’t
        impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive
        manner.
      </div>
      <h2>Rule 6</h2>
      <div>
        Ensure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by properly
        labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic,
        sexually-explicit, or offensive.
      </div>
      <h2>Rule 7</h2>
      <div>
        Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or
        facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.
      </div>
      <h2>Rule 8</h2>
      <div>
        Don’t break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of
        Reddit.
