      <h1>Reddit Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our
        users to be the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we
        want to help you understand how and why Reddit, Inc. ("Reddit," "we" or
        "us") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our
        websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products
        and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise
        interact with us or receive a communication from us. We want this
        privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how you use
        Reddit. We'd love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't,
        here is the TL;DR:
      </div>
      <div>
        We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by
        default. If you want to just browse, you don't need an account. If you
        want to create an account to participate in a subreddit, we don't
        require you to give us your real name. We don't track your precise
        location. You can even browse anonymously. You can share as much or as
        little about yourself as you want when using Reddit.
      </div>
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <div>We use information about you to:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li>
        <li>
          Personalize services, content, and features that match your
          activities, preferences, and settings;
        </li>
        <li>
          Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes
          blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the
          Reddit User Agreement and our other terms and policies, as well as
          comply with applicable law;
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown
          on our Services;
        </li>
        <li>Research and develop new services;</li>
        <li>
          Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and
          other support and administrative messages;
        </li>
        <li>Provide customer service;</li>
        <li>
          Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions,
          events, and programs, and provide other news and information we think
          will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of
          these communications, see "Your Choices" below);
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with
          our Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reddit Is a Public Platform</h2>
      <div>
        Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to
        everyone, even without an account. By using the Services, you are
        directing us to share this information publicly and freely. When you
        submit content (e.g., a post, comment, or chat message) to a public part
        of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able
        to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the
        date and time you originally submitted the content. That content and
        information may also be available in search results on Internet search
        engines like Google. You should take the public nature of the Services
        into consideration before posting. Your Reddit account has a profile
        page that is public. Your profile contains information about your
        activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and
        comments, karma, trophies received, profile display name, about section,
        and social links, avatar or profile image, moderator, contributor, and
        Reddit Premium status, communities you are active in, and how long you
        have been a member of the Services (your cake day). We offer social
        sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our
        Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the
        sharing of certain information with your friends or the public,
        depending on the settings you establish with the third party that
        provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the
        purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with
        social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third
        parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr,
        Facebook, and X). Reddit allows moderators to access Reddit content
        using moderator bots and tools. Reddit also allows other third parties
        to access public Reddit content using Reddit's developer services,
        including Reddit Embeds, our APIs, Developer Platform, and similar
        technologies. We limit third-party access to this content and require
        third parties to pay licensing fees for access to larger quantities of
        content. Reddit's Developer Terms are our standard terms governing how
        these services are used by third parties.
      </div>
      <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            With your consent. We may share information about you with your
            consent or at your direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            With linked services. If you link your Reddit account with a
            third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize
            with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as
            described in "Your Rights and Choices" below.
          </li>
          <li>
            With our service providers. We may share information with vendors,
            consultants, and other service providers who need access to such
            information to carry out work for us. Their use of personal data
            will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security
            measures. A few examples: (i) payment processors who process
            transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data
            and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who
            help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our
            Services, and (iv) compliance providers who help us determine your
            eligibility to participate in Reddit Programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            To comply with the law. We may share information if we believe
            disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable
            law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including,
            but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement
            requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to
            provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in
            response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional
            information about how we respond to government requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            In an emergency. We may share information if we believe it's
            necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
          </li>
          <li>
            To enforce our rights and promote safety and security. We may share
            information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our
            User Agreement, rules, or other Reddit terms and policies, or to
            protect the rights, property, and safety of the Services, ourselves,
            and others.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
      <div>
        We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft,
        misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
        For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We
        also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which
        of our employees have access to non-public personal information. You can
        help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor
        authentication. We store the information we collect for as long as it is
        necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We
        may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes and/or
        if we believe doing so is in accordance with, or as required by, any
        applicable law. For example, if you violate our policies and your
        account is suspended or banned, we may store the identifiers used to
        create the account (such as phone number) to prevent you from creating
        new accounts.
